# Multi-Model Image Generation Comparison App

## What is this app?

An AI image generation comparison tool that lets users:

1. **Enter a single prompt** - Type what image you want to create
2. **Generate across multiple models** - Same prompt runs through different AI models (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
3. **Compare results side-by-side** - See how different models interpret your prompt
4. **Download favorites** - Save the images you like best

Think of it like A/B testing for AI art - helping users find which model works best for their specific needs and style preferences.

**Example Use Case:** 
User types "futuristic cityscape at sunset" → Gets 3 different interpretations from 3 AI models → Can compare styles, quality, and accuracy → Downloads the best result.

Perfect for artists, designers, content creators, and anyone curious about AI image generation differences.
